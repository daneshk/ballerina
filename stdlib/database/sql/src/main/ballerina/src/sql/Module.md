## Module overview

This module provides the common interface and functionality to interact with a database. The corresponding database
clients can be created by using specific database modules such as `MySQL` or using the Java Database Connectivity 
module `JDBC`.

### List of Database Modules
1. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Module
This module can be used to connect with any database by simply providing the JDBC URL and the other related properties. 
For more details, see the [JDBC module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html).


2. MySQL Module  
This module is specially designed to work with a MySQL database and allows to access the functionality 
provided by MySQL 8.0.x onwards. For more details, see the [MySQL module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html).


### Client

The database client should be created using any of the above-listed database modules and once it is created, the 
operations and functionality explained below can be used. 

#### Connection pool handling

All database modules share the same connection pooling concept and there are 3 possible scenarios for 
connection pool handling.  For its properties and possible values, see the `sql:ConnectionPool`.  

1. Global shareable default connection pool

    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally-shareable pool will be 
    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. 
    The JDBC module example below shows how the global connection pool is used. 

    ```ballerina
    jdbc:Client|sql:Error dbClient = 
                               new ("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb", 
                                "root", "root");
    ```

2. Client owned, unsharable connection pool

    If you define the `connectionPool` field inline when creating the database client with the `sql:ConnectionPool` type, 
    an unsharable connection pool will be created. The JDBC module example below shows how the global 
    connection pool is used.

    ```ballerina
    jdbc:Client|sql:Error dbClient = 
                               new (url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb", 
                               connectionPool = { maxOpenConnections: 5 });
    ```

3. Local, shareable connection pool

    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, 
    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared 
    connection pool will be created. The JDBC module example below shows how the global connection pool is used.

    ```ballerina
    sql:ConnectionPool connPool = {maxOpenConnections: 5};
    
    jdbc:Client|sql:Error dbClient1 =       
                               new (url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb",
                               connectionPool = connPool);
    jdbc:Client|sql:Error dbClient2 = 
                               new (url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb",
                               connectionPool = connPool);
    jdbc:Client|sql:Error dbClient3 = 
                               new (url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb",
                               connectionPool = connPool);
    ```
    
#### Closing the client

Once all the database operations are performed, you can close the database client you have created by invoking the `close()`
operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients. 

```ballerina
error? e = dbClient.close();
if (e is error){
    io:println("Error occured:", e);
}

```    
### Database operations

Once the client is created, database operations can be executed through that client. This module defines the interface 
and common properties that are shared among multiple database clients.  It also supports querying, inserting, deleting, 
updating, and batch updating data.  

#### Creating tables

This sample creates a table with two columns. One column is of type `int`and the other is of type `varchar`.
The CREATE statement is executed via the `execute` remote function of the client.

```ballerina
// Create the ‘Students’ table with the  ‘id’, 'name' and ‘age’ fields.
var ret = dbClient->execute("CREATE TABLE student(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, " +
                         "age INT, name VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY (id))");
if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {
    io:println("Students table create status in DB: ", ret.affectedRowCount);
} else {
    error err = ret;
    io:println("Students table creation failed: ", err.message());
}
```

#### Inserting data

This sample shows three examples of data insertion by executing an INSERT statement using the `execute` remote function 
of the client.

In the first example, the query parameter values are passed directly into the query statement of the `execute` 
remote function.

```ballerina
var ret = dbClient->execute("INSERT INTO student(age, name) " +
                         "values (23, 'john')");
if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {
    io:println("Inserted row count to Students table: ", ret.affectedRowCount);
} else {
    error err = ret;
    io:println("Insert to Students table failed: ", err.message());
}
```

In the second example, the parameter values, which are in local variables are used to parameterize the SQL query in 
the `execute` remote function. This type of a parameterized SQL query can be used with any primitive Ballerina type 
like `string`, `int`, `float`, or `boolean` and in that case, the corresponding SQL type of the parameter is derived 
from the type of the Ballerina variable that is passed in. 

```ballerina
string name = "Anne";
int age = 8;

sql:ParameterizedQuery query = `INSERT INTO student(age, name)
                                values (${age}, ${name})`;
var ret = dbClient->execute(query);
if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {
    io:println("Inserted row count to Students table: ", ret.affectedRowCount);
} else {
    error err = ret;
    io:println("Insert to Students table failed: ", err.message());
}
```

In the third example, the parameter values are passed as a `sql:TypedValue` to the `execute` remote function. Use the 
corresponding subtype of the `sql:TypedValue` such as `sql:Varchar`, `sql:Char`, `sql:Integer`, etc, when you need to 
provide more details such as the exact SQL type of the parameter.

```ballerina
sql:VarcharValue name = new ("James");
sql:IntegerValue age = new (10);

sql:ParameterizedQuery query = `INSERT INTO student(age, name)
                                values (${age}, ${name})`;
var ret = dbClient->execute(query);
f (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {
    io:println("Inserted row count to Students table: ", ret.affectedRowCount);
} else {
    error err = ret;
    io:println("Insert to Students table failed: ", err.message());
}
```

#### Inserting data with auto-generated keys

This example demonstrates inserting data while returning the auto-generated keys. It achieves this by using the 
`execute` remote function to execute the INSERT statement.

```ballerina
int age = 31;
string name = "Kate";

sql:ParameterizedQuery query = `INSERT INTO student(age, name)
                                values (${age}, ${name})`;
var ret = dbClient->execute(query);
if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {
    int? count = ret.affectedRowCount;
    string|int? generatedKey = ret.lastInsertId;
    io:println("Inserted row count: ", count);
    io:println("Generated key: ", generatedKey);
} else {
    error err = ret;
    io:println("Insert to table failed: ", err.message());
}
```

#### Querying data

This sample shows three examples to demonstrate the different usages of the `query` operation and query the
database table and obtain the results. 

This example demonstrates querying data from a table in a database. 
First, a type is created to represent the returned result set. Note the mapping of the database column 
to the returned record's property is case insensitive (i.e., `ID` column in the result can be mapped to the `id` 
property in the record). Next, the SELECT query is executed via the `query` remote function of the client by passing that 
result set type. Once the query is executed, each data record can be retrieved by looping the result set. The `stream` 
returned by the select operation holds a pointer to the actual data in the database and it loads data from the table 
only when it is accessed. This stream can be iterated only once. 

```ballerina
// Define a type to represent the results.
type Student record {
    int id;
    int age;
    string name;
};

// Select the data from the database table. The query parameters are passed 
// directly. Similar to the `execute` examples, parameters can be passed as
// sub types of `sql:TypedValue` as well.
int id = 10;
int age = 12;
sql:ParameterizedQuery query = `SELECT * FROM students
                                WHERE id < ${id} AND age > ${age}`;
stream<Student, sql:Error> resultStream = 
        <stream<Student, sql:Error>> dbClient->query(query, Student);

// Iterating the returned table.
error? e = resultStream.forEach(function(Student student) {
   io:println("Student Id: ", student.id);
   io:println("Student age: ", student.age);
   io:println("Student name: ", student.name);
});
if (e is error) {
   io:println("Query execution failed.", e);
}
```

Defining the return type is optional and you can query the database without providing the result type. Hence, 
the above example can be modified as follows with an open record type as the return type. The property name in the open record 
type will be the same as how the column is defined in the database. 

```ballerina
// Select the data from the database table. The query parameters are passed 
// directly. Similar to the `execute` examples, parameters can be passed as 
// sub types of `sql:TypedValue` as well.
int id = 10;
int age = 12;
sql:ParameterizedQuery query = `SELECT * FROM students
                                WHERE id < ${id} AND age > ${age}`;
stream<record{}, sql:Error> resultStream = dbClient->query(query);

// Iterating the returned table.
error? e = resultStream.forEach(function(record{} student) {
   io:println("Student Id: ", student["id"]);
   io:println("Student age: ", student["age"]);
   io:println("Student name: ", student["name"];
});
if (e is error) {
   io:println("Query execution failed.", e);
}
```

There are situations in which you may not want to iterate through the database and in that case, you may decide
to only use the `next()` operation in the result `stream` and retrieve the first record. In such cases, the returned
result stream will not be closed and you have to explicitly invoke the `close` operation on the 
`sql:Client` to release the connection resources and avoid a connection leak as shown below.

```ballerina
stream<record{}, sql:Error> resultStream = 
            dbClient->query("SELECT count(*) as total FROM students");

record {|record {} value;|}|error? result = resultStream.next();

if (result is record {|record {} value;|}) {
    io:println("Total students : ", result.value["total"]);
} else if (result is error) {
    io:println("Error encoutered when executing query. ", result);
} else {
    io:println("Student table is empty");
}

error? e = resultStream.close();
if(e is error){
    io:println("Error when closing the stream", e);
}
```

#### Updating data

This example demonstrates modifying data by executing an UPDATE statement via the `execute` remote function of 
the client.

```ballerina
int age = 23;
sql:ParameterizedQuery query = `UPDATE students SET name = 'John' 
                                WHERE age = ${age}`;
var ret = dbClient->execute(query);
if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {
    io:println("Updated row count in Students table: ", ret.affectedRowCount);
} else {
    error err = ret;
    io:println("Update to students table failed: ", err.message());
}
```

#### Deleting data

This example demonstrates deleting data by executing a DELETE statement via the `execute` remote function of 
the client.

```ballerina
string name = "John";
sql:ParameterizedQuery query = `DELETE from students WHERE name = ${name}`;
var ret = dbClient->execute(query);
if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {
    io:println("Deleted student count: ", ret.affectedRowCount);
} else {
    error err = ret;
    io:println("Delete from students table failed: ", err.message());
}
```

#### Batch updating data

This example demonstrates how to insert multiple records with a single INSERT statement that is executed via the 
`batchExecute` remote function of the client. This is done by creating a `table` with multiple records and 
parameterized SQL query as same as the  above `execute` operations.

```ballerina
// Create the table with the records that need to be inserted.
var data = [
  { name: "John", age: 25  },
  { name: "Peter", age: 24 },
  { name: "jane", age: 22 }
];

// Do the batch update by passing the batches.
sql:ParameterizedQuery[] batch = from var row in data
                                 select `INSERT INTO students ('name', 'age')
                                 VALUES (${row.name}, ${row.age})`;
var ret = dbClient->batchExecute(batch);

if (ret is error) {
    io:println("Error occurred:", err.message());
} else {
    io:println("Batch item 1 update count: ", ret[0].affectedRowCount);
    io:println("Batch item 2 update count: ", ret[1].affectedRowCount);
}
```

#### Execute SQL stored procedures

This example demonstrates how to execute a stored procedure with a single INSERT statement that is executed via the 
`call` remote function of the client.

```ballerina
int uid = 10;
sql:OutParameter insertId = new;

var ret = dbClient->call(`call InsertPerson(${uid}, ${insertId})`);
if (ret is error) {
    io:println("Error occurred:", err.message());
} else {
    io:println("Outparameter insert id: ", insertId.get(int));
    stream<record{}, sql:Error>? resultStr = ret.queryResult;
    if (!(resultStr is ())) {
        sql:Error? e = resultStr.forEach(function(record{} result) {
        io:println("Full Customer details: ", result);
      });
    } else {
        io:println("Stored  procedure does not return anything.");
    }
}
```

>**Note:** The default thread pool size used in Ballerina is the number of processors available * 2. You can configure
the thread pool size by using the `BALLERINA_MAX_POOL_SIZE` environment variable.
